<h2 id="whatisheadquartersfordcsworld">What is Headquarters for DCS World?</h2>

<p>Headquarters for DCS World (HQ4DCS) is a massively improved version of DCS World's own fast mission generator. HQ4DCS allows 
you to create complete scenarios in just a few clicks. Missions generated with HQ4DCS tend to be rather "player-centric". 
Their purpose is not to simulate a real war theater, like Falcon 4's dynamic campaign, but to provide the player(s) with 
interesting objectives and challenges. This approach is a perfect fit for DCS World's limited number of units and very capable
 scripting engine.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!<br />
As many of you have noticed, development of HQ4DCS has stalled since late August. Due to some recent and unfortunate circumstances in my life, I had to stop working on my open source projects. Don't worry, everything is back to normal now, and development of both planned and new features will resume soon. As a matter of respect for my backers, I declined recurring Paypal donations for the months during which I did not update the project.<br />
My untold goal was to make sure open beta 2 would be available before the DCS: Viper early access, and I was pretty confident I could be faster than Eagle Dynamics, well... I was wrong :)<br />
Thanks again for your support, and sorry again about this delay.</p>

<p><strong>HQ4DCS Open Beta 2 will be open source!</strong>
You read that right: the next version of HQ4DCS will be open source and hosted on GitHub. The new code (more than 80% of the code from Open Beta 1 has been rewritten from scratch) is faster, leaner, more open, and will allow for easy modding and upgrades. While I'm busy polishing the next version (I will commit the full C# source code to the repository as soon as all basic mission generation features are done), the old deprecated version of the program can still be downloaded from this page.</p>

<p>Although Open Beta 2 is not available yet, you may already to take a peek at the new version's features on the <a href="https://github.com/akaAgar/headquarters-for-dcs">source code repository</a>. The very early (and incomplete) draft of the modding guide will give you an idea of the way .ini files will work. Browsing the Library directory will also help you realize how easy adding or modifying mission types, units, coalitions and theaters will be.</p>

<h3 id="25may2019">25 May 2019</h3>

<p>It's been some time without news and an update is long overdue.</p>

<p>First of all, many thanks to all of you who donated to my PayPal or sent me bugfixes and suggestions, it feels good knowing the DCS community is invested in this project.
Progress on the open beta 2 has been going well. Not only are most bugs from open beta 1 now fixed, but I've devised a way to easily implement carrier ops, which should be ready for open beta 3. By the way, future updates should come a LOT faster: most of the work being done now on open beta 2 will ensure a very lean and clean codebase to allow for easy improvement and modifications.</p>

<p>Which brings me to today's subject: the long-awaited .ini file system. No longer is all data hardcoded in the program itself. Everything, from enemy air defense settings to mission types to theaters to coalitions, and much more, is now conveniently stored in .ini files for easy edition and modding.</p>

<p>The ETA for open beta 2 is still early June â€“ in the worst case scenario, it will be available before July.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your support !</p>

<h3 id="15apr2019">15 Apr 2019</h3>

<p>The cause of the false positive with some antivirus program has been found: it was triggered by the Lua code embedded in HQ4DCS.exe (while the main program is C#, most of the mission generation code is written in Lua). In order to fix this, I'm currently porting most of the mission generation logic to C#, which takes some time.</p>

<p>Now for the good news: the C# code, unsurprisingly, turns out to be a lot faster (mission generation now literally takes half a second) and will be a lot easier to maintain and improve. It also opens new possibilities for the mission generator: instead of loading data about countries, theaters, payloads and units from Lua tables, the new version now uses .ini files, which allow for very easy customization. You've read that right: not only will the next version of HQ4DCS will be a lot faster, leaner and stable, but users will be able to mod it to add new payloads, units or even mission types.</p>

<p>Of course, porting all the code to C# will require a little more work that writing a quick hotfix for the open beta 1, but I'm convinced this is for the better and will make sure further updates come a lot faster.</p>

<p>The next version, known as open beta 2, should be released mid-May, early June.</p>

<h3 id="01apr2019">01 Apr 2019</h3>

<p>I started working on the first hotfix, which should iron out most of the bugs users have found in Open Beta 1. Once the hotfix is released, I'll gradually add additional features, content and mission types. To make bug reports easier, and to help you get a better idea of what is done an what's left to do, a Trello development board has been added on this page. Don't hesitate to send feedback, bug reports and suggestions if you notice something missing.</p>
