## What is Headquarters for DCS World?
Headquarters for DCS World (HQ4DCS) is a massively improved version of DCS World's own fast mission generator. HQ4DCS allows you to create complete scenarios in just a few clicks. Missions generated with HQ4DCS tend to be rather "player-centric". Their purpose is not to simulate a real war theater, like Falcon 4's dynamic campaign, but to provide the player(s) with interesting objectives and challenges. This approach is a perfect fit for DCS World's limited number of units and very capable scripting engine.

**Open Beta 2 is still a work in progress and contains several (potentially breaking) bugs. Until a somewhat stable release of OB2 is available, the old, unsupported version of HQ4DCS is available on the [project page](https://akaagar.github.io/headquarters-for-dcs/).**
